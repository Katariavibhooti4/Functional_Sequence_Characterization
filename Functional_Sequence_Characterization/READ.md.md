\# **In-Silico Functional Characterization of a Hypothetical Protein**



\## Project Overview

This project performs computational identification and functional characterization of a hypothetical protein using sequence analysis and homology-based annotation.



\## Objective

To predict the biological function of an unknown protein sequence using bioinformatics tools.



\## Tools Used

\- NCBI Protein Database

\- BLASTp

\- Conserved Domain Database (CDD)

\- Biopython

\- Python

\- VS Code



\## Workflow

1\. Retrieval of protein sequence from NCBI

2\. Sequence quality analysis using Biopython

3\. Homology search using BLASTp

4\. Functional prediction based on similar proteins

5\. Conserved domain analysis for functional confirmation



\## Key Findings

The protein sequence showed high similarity with cystathionine gamma-lyase/homocysteine desulfhydrase enzymes from Bacillus species. Conserved domain analysis confirmed the presence of a PLP-dependent catalytic domain involved in sulfur amino acid metabolism.



\## Conclusion

The hypothetical protein was successfully annotated as a sulfur metabolism enzyme using in-silico bioinformatics approaches.

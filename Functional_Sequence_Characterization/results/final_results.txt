RESULTS

1. Sequence Retrieval
A hypothetical protein (WP_003229810.1) from Bacillus species was retrieved from the NCBI database. The sequence length was 379 amino acids.

2. Sequence Quality Analysis
Biopython analysis showed a normal amino acid composition and confirmed that the sequence is biologically valid.

3. Homology Search (BLASTp)
BLASTp analysis showed 99–100% similarity with bifunctional cystathionine gamma-lyase / homocysteine desulfhydrase proteins from Bacillus species.

4. Conserved Domain Analysis
CDD search identified domain PRK07671 belonging to the AAT_I superfamily, characteristic of PLP-dependent enzymes involved in sulfur amino acid metabolism.

5. Functional Prediction
The protein is predicted to function as a cystathionine gamma-lyase/homocysteine desulfhydrase enzyme involved in bacterial sulfur metabolism.

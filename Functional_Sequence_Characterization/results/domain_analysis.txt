Conserved Domain Analysis

Tool Used: NCBI Conserved Domain Database (CDD)

Query Protein: WP_003229810.1
Organism: Bacillus species

Identified Domain:
Name: Bifunctional cystathionine gamma-lyase / homocysteine desulfhydrase
Accession: PRK07671
Superfamily: AAT_I (Aminotransferase Class I and II family)

Domain Interval: 1–377 amino acids
E-value: 0.0

Functional Description:
The identified domain belongs to the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme family. These enzymes catalyze reactions in sulfur amino acid metabolism, specifically the conversion of cystathionine to cysteine and homocysteine to sulfide.

Biological Significance:
Proteins in this family play a role in the reverse transsulfuration pathway and are important in bacterial sulfur metabolism.

Conclusion from Domain Analysis:
The presence of the PRK07671 conserved catalytic domain strongly confirms that the query protein functions as a cystathionine gamma-lyase/homocysteine desulfhydrase enzyme.
